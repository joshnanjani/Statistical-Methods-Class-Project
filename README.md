# Statistical-Methods-Class-Project
The broader goal of this project is to implement the topics covered in the Course Syllabus in a real-life situation. 
All the groups were given data (sets of numbers) demonstrating 
1) the daily ETF return
2) the daily relative change in the price of the crude oil
3) the daily relative change in the gold prices
4) the daily return of the JPMorgan &amp;Co stock.
