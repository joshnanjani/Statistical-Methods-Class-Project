# Statistical-Methods-Class-Project
The broader goal of this project is to implement the topics covered in the Course Syllabus in a real-life situation. All the groups were given data (sets of numbers) demonstrating the daily ETF return, the daily relative change in the price of the crude oil; the daily relative change in the gold prices, and the daily return of the JPMorgan &amp;Co stock.
