# Statistical Methods Class Project
The broader goal of this project is to implement the topics covered in the Course Syllabus in a real-life situation. 
We have received datasets of:-
1) the daily ETF return
2) the daily relative change in the price of the crude oil
3) the daily relative change in the gold prices
4) the daily return of the JPMorgan &amp;Co stock.

Project steps:-
a) Firstly, our group needed to obtain the data (comprised of 1000 values each) and find the mean and standard deviation for each variable. 
b) Secondly, our group had to describe the data given, creating histograms and time series plots, as well as scatter plots between different pairs of data. 
c) The next step was to determine which distribution the data follow, by performing the appropriate tests. 
d) In order to discuss the Central Limit Theorem, we broke our data (the population) into smaller groups (samples) of different sizes each time, and compare their means and standard deviations with the population characteristics. 
e) Next, we selected one of the aforementioned samples and constructed confidence intervals for the mean. 
f) The sixth part of the project tested our ability to construct and perform hypothesis tests on our data. 
g) We also performed hypothesis testing between different columns ( which we treated as samples from different populations). 
h) Our group was then expected to fit regression lines to various scatter plots featuring correlations of different columns as well as perform at-test. 
i) Part nine of the present project entails evaluating the models we assumed in the previous section. Lastly, our group checked the residuals of the model fitting using various tools available.
